    "For this exercise, we'll use a subset of the [baby names data set](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip). After unzipping the zip file, you'll find individual files `yob2000.txt`, `yob2001.txt`, ... `yob2014.txt`, and `yob2015.txt`. Each file lists babies born in a specific year of birth (`yob`) who were issued a US social security number. The files are broken up into gender, name, and births per name for all babies that were born in that year. Names that were assigned fewer than 5 times in a given birth year are excluded."
